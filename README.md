# Pirate Code
A project from high school that is still currently being used today.
Our working codename for the development of the project was ticketmaster, so the portion I worked on was ticketmaster_ios.

This is a project that I and 13 others developed in high school to give the faculty a way to reward the students for good behavior.
The admin staff could then reward the faculty for effectively rewarding the students. The system was already in place but our Capstone class team moved it to be entirely digital.

The specific branch that I worked on was the iOS app portion of the project. This portion was worked on by myself as well as Dylan Robert Bolter.

The system, which is titled the Pirate Code, is still currently being used by the Pattonville High School to reward students and teachers.

**The specific pods for the project are not uploaded into the repository, but they are present in the zip file, which is identical to the repository in every other way.**
